Title: Basis of the Euclid's plane geometry
Description: This is a more recent version of the basis of Euclid's plane geometry, the previous version was the contribution intitled RulerCompassGeometry.
The plane geometry is defined as a set of points, with two predicates : Clokwise for the orientation and Equidistant for the metric and three constructors, Ruler for the lines, Compass for the circles and Intersection for the points.
For using it, we suggest to compile the files the name of which begin by a capital letter and a number from A1 to N7 in the lexicographic order and to keep modifiable the files of tacics (from Tactic1 to Tactic4) and the files of examples (Hilbert and Bolyai).
Keywords: plane geometry, Euclid, ruler and compass
